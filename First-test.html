<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p> This is an HTML page that I created in TextEdit.</p>
<p/>I intend to <b />add</b> quite a few interesting information to it related to </ b> our time in <I><b>isolation.</I> </b> </p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Today was my son's <strong>4<sup>th</sup>Birthday!</strong>.<br />We had initially planned to have it in a <em>kids play area</em> somewhere in London,<br />but unfortunately the current<I>'Stay Home' policy</I> left us with no alternative but a house celebration.</p>
<p><abbr title="Prime Minister"</abbr> PM Boris Johnson is currently in quarantine. So is his <abbr title ="Chief advisor"</abbr></em> CA Daniel</em> Cumming,<em> <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer"</abbr> </em>CMO Professor Whitty and the <abbr title=Health Secretary</abbr> <em>Matt Hancock</em>
</p>.</b>Quite difficult to know where this ends.</p>
<p class="credits"><b>BE SAFE. STAY AT HOME AND SAVE LIVES.</b> </p>


<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p> Today just like any other day in this uncertain time, I have not left the house. Lockdown continues.</P>
<p> I spent the most of the day <I>Home schooling</I> my daughter. It is <delete>not fun</delete> <insert> that's an understatement.</insert></p> <p>I started to believe that she would do with some<I>extra</I>attention, which I don't believe is fair to lump on teachers in a class environment.</p>.
I didn't do much of coding apart from learning linking web pages within websites.</p>
<p> However on a positive note, I got my first <strong>freelance Project</strong>. It is to build a Website for <b>Tasty-Boo</b> a beverage company. You can follow it <a href="file:///Users/collins/Downloads/Tasty-Boo%20Project.html">here</a></p>

<h2>Day 4 </h2>
<p>Sadly the case that I have sort of got into the routine of ensuring I am in the living room for 9AM! Strange times indeed considering the London daily rush we have lived under for decades of working life; late night, early wake, overground Train, Underground... </p>. I learnt yesterday that I was to be <strongFURLOUGHED </strong>for 3 weeks! Basically will not have to go to work, but instead of the my Employers picking up the cost of my wages, the Government will pay 80% of my wages.To be honest I was quite relieved knowing I don't have to go out there. Out there feels like a zombie world. You know those places in the movie with seem unrealistic? Those scenes where the town is deserted and everyone treats the other like a potential suspect?- That sort of movie. Experienced that myself today when went to my local shop to get some supplies. Its not unusual when you have 3 kids off school unexpectedly for 2 weeks now. Anyway managed to do some two hours of coding with involved learning about creating links to specific parts of a webpage. Find some of my work <a href="file:///Users/collins/Downloads/MenuProject/Menu.html">here</a></p>

<h2>Day 5</h2>
<p>To we had a Bbq because the weather was quite good and couldn't resist after this whole week of lockdown. Talking of cOVID 19, The Prime Minister has been admitted in Hospital. The virus seems to have taken hold of him. Anyway we can only hope for the best as "bright times are on their way" according to the Queen in today's speech. The Queen did have a national televised addresss and mind you these don't come very often.</p>
<p> On the Web front I have not done as much as I would have wanted to these last 2 days because I was trying to figure out how to load an image on a website. You must be wondering how this could have been a problem, but it was a silly oversight as I kept typing "scr" instead of "src".Any way find below an image from today.</p><br />

<img src="BBQ.JPEG" alt="Covid19 BBQ" width="300" height="300"><br /><br />

<h2>Day 6</h2>
<p>Today got to learn about Tables, Rows and columns.Quite a bit to take in but seems doable. Decided to practice my new acquired knowledge while compiling the figures to date on the impact of COVID19.The casualties seem to increase in most parts of the world especially the USA and Europe.Although on the positive note, figures of new infections in Spain and Italy are lowering giving the belief that the peak has been reached. However there is hesitation in celebrating these developments as it may give the population a false sense of security  which may lead to relaxation towards the social distancing policies that have led to this improvement in numbers.France however saw a spike of over 800 deaths which is in contrast to the 300 and 400 deaths last Friday and Saturday respectively. A stack reminder that the battle is not over yet. In England the death toll today was 438 and our PM Boris Johnson has been admitted into intensive care in the St Thomas Hospital after his condition worsened this afternoon. We pray for him and his family.

<h2>Day 7</h2>

<h2>Day 8</h2>
<p>Today I continued with learning forms. I enjoyed the topic and quite like testing the features. Only wish I had a live server to access. Quite glad with my progress on this journey. And intend to utilise the current lockdown. Covid19 is still claiming many lives-887 deaths in the UK today (9/4/20). On the positive side though, our Prime Minister is out of intensive care but still in the general ward. We wish him the best and our sincere condolences to all that have lost loved ones who in most cases never got the chance to give their farewells.

<h2>Day 10</h2>
<p>
Yesterday I started learning CSS and used some of my knowledge to update on this page. The Corona virus is still a serious public health issue. There have been a further 778 deaths today bring the total to 12,107. I feel sorry for all that have lost loved ones.Today the national quarantine measures are to continue for a further 3 weeks. 
</p>

<h2>Day 11</h2>
<p class="intro">Today is the 20/04/20. We have had  a sunny weekend in <a class= "credits">london </a> and had chance to go for a walk along the river next to my house. Took my daughter with him and we both had a great time. it is a month since we had ventured out and attached some photos. On the code fron i have been learning CSS but the concepts arenumerous and not bee able to include them in all my work, so I have decided to include them in todays text. Pardon me for the inconsistencies in today's post.

<h2>Day 12</h2>
<p>Hi freinds, I have not updated my blog in quite a few days but I have not in anyway away from coding. I was finding continuing my learning of CSS by using a separate CSS sheet. It seemed quite cumbersome uprooting the existing code from this blog to format a separate CSS sheet, and therefore decided to pursue my first commercial project of the <strong>Tasty-Boo</strong> website. I have committed my work to Github if you want to have a look. In as far as the the lockdown is concerned, the situation continues to be grim. We have been losing an average of 600 live to Covid19 in the past 4 days. ATo day we hit the <strong>20,000</strong> mark!. The PM left Hospital few weeks ago, but continues to recover from his country home. He is yet to return to full time duty and although the team has tried to fight this without him, his absense is undeniable.</p> Anyway I have uploaded a video to give you a glimpse of my new work on <strong> Tasty-Boo website</strong>. it is great, certainly more eye-catching. Tell me what you think </p>
