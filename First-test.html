<h1> Welcome to my first web page</h1>
<p> This is an HTML page that I created in TextEdit.</p>
<p/>I intend to <b/>add</b> quite a few interesting information to it related to </ b> our time in <I><b>isolation.</I> </b> </p>
<p>Today was my son's <b>4<sup>th</sup>Birthday!</b>.<br />We had initially planned to have it in a <em>kids play area</em> somewhere in London,<br />but unfortunately the current<I>'Stay Home' policy</I> left us with no alternative but a house celebration.</p>
<p><abbr title="Prime Minister"</abbr> PM Boris Johnson is currently in <I>quarentine.</I>together with his <em>Chief advisor</em> Daniel Cumming,<br /><em>Chief Medical Officer</em> Professor Whitty and the <em>Health Secretary</em> Matt Hancock</p>.
<p/>Quite difficult to know where this ends.</p>
