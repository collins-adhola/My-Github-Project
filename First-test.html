<h1> Welcome to my first web page</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p> This is an HTML page that I created in TextEdit.</p>
<p/>I intend to <b />add</b> quite a few interesting information to it related to </ b> our time in <I><b>isolation.</I> </b> </p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Today was my son's <strong>4<sup>th</sup>Birthday!</strong>.<br />We had initially planned to have it in a <em>kids play area</em> somewhere in London,<br />but unfortunately the current<I>'Stay Home' policy</I> left us with no alternative but a house celebration.</p>
<p><abbr title="Prime Minister"</abbr> PM Boris Johnson is currently in quarantine. So is his <abbr title ="Chief advisor"</abbr></em> CA Daniel</em> Cumming,<em> <abbr title="Chief Medical Officer"</abbr> </em>CMO Professor Whitty and the <abbr title=Health Secretary</abbr> <em>Matt Hancock</em>
</p>.</b>Quite difficult to know where this ends.</p>
<p><b>BE SAFE. STAY AT HOME AND SAVE LIVES.</b> 
</p>


<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p> Today just like any other day in this uncertain time, I have not left the house. Lockdown continues.</P>
<p> I spent the most of the day <I>Home schooling</I> my daughter. It is <delete>not fun</delete> <insert> that's an understatement.</insert></p> <p>I started to believe that she would do with some<I>extra</I>attention, which I don't believe is fair to lump on teachers in a class environment.</p>.
I didn't do much of coding apart from learning linking web pages within websites.</p>
<p> However on a positive note, I got my first <strong>freelance Project</strong>. It is to build a Website for <b>Tasty-Boo</b> a beverage company. You can follow it <a href="file:///Users/collins/Downloads/Tasty-Boo%20Project.html">here</a></p>
